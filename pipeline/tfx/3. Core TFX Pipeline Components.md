### **3. Core TFX Pipeline Components**

---

#### **3.1 ExampleGen**

**ExampleGen** is the entry point of a TFX pipeline, responsible for ingesting raw data and converting it into a standardized format that can be used by subsequent components. It is the foundation on which the entire pipeline is built, ensuring that data is consistently and efficiently processed.

**Key Functions:**
- **Data Ingestion**: ExampleGen pulls in data from various sources like CSV files, BigQuery tables, or custom data sources.
- **Splitting Data**: ExampleGen can automatically split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Standardization**: It converts raw data into the `tf.Example` format, a standard TensorFlow format used by downstream components.

**Practical Application**: Suppose you're building a model to predict housing prices. You might have data in CSV format containing information about house features and prices. ExampleGen would ingest this CSV data, split it into training and validation sets, and prepare it for further processing.

---

##### **3.1.1 CSVExampleGen**

**CSVExampleGen** is a specialized version of ExampleGen designed to handle data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. CSV is one of the most common data formats, making CSVExampleGen widely used in many pipelines.

**How It Works:**
- **Ingesting Data**: You specify the path to your CSV files, and CSVExampleGen reads the data.
- **Data Splitting**: By default, CSVExampleGen splits the data into 2/3 for training and 1/3 for evaluation, but you can customize this split.
- **Standardization**: It converts each row of the CSV file into a `tf.Example` format.

**Example**: If you have a CSV file with customer data (age, income, etc.) and a target variable (whether they bought a product), CSVExampleGen would ingest this data and prepare it for model training.

---

##### **3.1.2 BigQueryExampleGen**

**BigQueryExampleGen** is another variant of ExampleGen, specifically designed to ingest data from Google BigQuery, a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse.

**How It Works:**
- **Ingesting Data**: You provide a SQL query that selects the data you want to ingest from BigQuery.
- **Data Splitting**: Similar to CSVExampleGen, BigQueryExampleGen can split data into training and evaluation sets.
- **Standardization**: It converts the query results into the `tf.Example` format.

**Practical Application**: Imagine you have a large dataset stored in BigQuery containing millions of records. Instead of exporting this data to CSV, you can use BigQueryExampleGen to directly pull the data into your TFX pipeline for training a machine learning model.

---

##### **3.1.3 Custom ExampleGen**

**Custom ExampleGen** is used when your data source doesn't fit the standard formats provided by CSVExampleGen or BigQueryExampleGen. It allows you to create your own data ingestion logic.

**How It Works:**
- **Custom Input Format**: You can define your own data reader and converter to ingest and standardize data from any source, such as APIs, NoSQL databases, or streaming data.
- **Flexibility**: Custom ExampleGen offers the flexibility to handle non-traditional data formats or perform complex data preprocessing before standardization.

**Example**: If your data is stored in a proprietary format or is being streamed from an IoT device, you would use Custom ExampleGen to ingest and preprocess this data according to your specific requirements.

**Key Functions:**
- **Schema Inference**: It automatically generates a schema based on the data's statistics.
- **Data Validation**: The schema serves as a blueprint for validating incoming data, ensuring that it meets expected standards.

**Practical Application**: For example, if your dataset includes a feature "age" that should only contain positive integers, SchemaGen will capture this constraint in the schema. This schema will then be used to validate new data, ensuring that all values for "age" are positive integers.

---

#### **3.4 ExampleValidator**

**ExampleValidator** is responsible for validating the data against the schema generated by SchemaGen. It checks for anomalies, missing values, and other issues that might affect model performance.

**Key Functions:**
- **Data Validation**: Compares the data to the schema and identifies any anomalies.
- **Error Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on data anomalies, such as unexpected null values, out-of-range values, or incorrect data types.

**Practical Application**: Suppose SchemaGen expects the "income" feature to be within a certain range. If ExampleValidator finds values outside this range, it will flag them as anomalies, allowing you to address these issues before training your model.

---

#### **3.5 Transform**

**Transform** is a powerful component that handles data preprocessing and feature engineering. It applies transformations to the data, such as normalization, bucketization, or creating new features, ensuring that the data is in the best possible format for model training.
