# Functions in Python

- In Python, functions are categorized based on various characteristics, such as how they're defined, their scope, and how they handle arguments and values. Here’s a detailed breakdown of different types of functions in Python:

### 1. **Built-in Functions**
   - **Definition**: These are functions that are part of the Python Standard Library and are always available.
   - **Examples**: 
     - `print()`: Prints values to the console.
     - `len()`: Returns the length of a sequence.
     - `type()`: Returns the type of an object.
     - `input()`: Accepts input from the user.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     print(len([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
     print(type("Hello"))  # Output: <class 'str'>
     ```

### 2. **User-defined Functions**
   - **Definition**: These are functions that you define yourself using the `def` keyword.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - They can take zero or more arguments.
     - They can return values using the `return` keyword.
     - If no return value is provided, `None` is returned by default.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     
     print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
     ```

### 3. **Lambda (Anonymous) Functions**
   - **Definition**: These are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can have multiple arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Useful for short, throwaway functions.
     - Often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     lambda arguments: expression
     ```
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     double = lambda x: x * 2
     print(double(5))  # Output: 10

     # Using lambda in sorted()
     items = [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]
     sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item[1])
     print(sorted_items)  # Output: [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]
     ```

### 4. **Recursive Functions**
   - **Definition**: A function that calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Commonly used for problems like factorials, Fibonacci sequences, or tree traversals.
     - Every recursive function must have a **base case** to prevent infinite recursion.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def factorial(n):
         if n == 1:  # Base case
             return 1
         else:
             return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case
     
     print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
     ```

### 5. **Higher-order Functions**
   - **Definition**: These are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return a function as their result.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - They are very useful in functional programming paradigms.
     - Common examples include `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def add(x, y):
         return x + y
     
     def apply(func, a, b):
         return func(a, b)

     result = apply(add, 10, 5)  # Using add as an argument
     print(result)  # Output: 15
     ```

### 6. **Generator Functions**
   - **Definition**: These are functions that return an iterator and allow you to iterate through a sequence of values one at a time, rather than storing them all in memory at once. They use the `yield` keyword.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Suitable for working with large datasets where loading everything into memory at once would be inefficient.
     - Once a generator's values are consumed, they cannot be reused unless re-generated.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def count_up_to(max_val):
         count = 1
         while count <= max_val:
             yield count  # Pauses and yields control back to the caller
             count += 1
     
     for number in count_up_to(5):
         print(number)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
     ```

### 7. **Nested Functions**
   - **Definition**: Functions that are defined inside other functions.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - The inner function can access variables from the outer function.
     - Useful for closures or creating helper functions that are only needed within the scope of the outer function.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def outer_function(text):
         def inner_function():
             print(text)
         inner_function()

     outer_function("Hello!")  # Output: Hello!
     ```

### 8. **Closures**
   - **Definition**: A closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Useful when you need to maintain state between function calls.
     - Achieved by defining a nested function and returning it while capturing variables from the outer function.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def outer_function(text):
         def inner_function():
             return text
         return inner_function
     
     closure = outer_function("Hello!")
     print(closure())  # Output: Hello!
     ```

### 9. **Coroutine Functions**
   - **Definition**: Coroutines are functions that can pause and resume their execution at multiple points using `await`. These are used in asynchronous programming and often defined with the `async def` keyword.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Useful for handling tasks that involve waiting (e.g., I/O operations) without blocking the main thread.
     - They must be awaited or run within an event loop like in `asyncio`.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def greet():
         print("Hello!")
         await asyncio.sleep(1)
         print("Goodbye!")

     asyncio.run(greet())  # Output: Hello! (waits 1 second) Goodbye!
     ```

### 10. **Static Methods**
   - **Definition**: A method inside a class that does not operate on an instance of the class and does not modify the class's state.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
     - Does not take a `self` or `cls` parameter.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     class MyClass:
         @staticmethod
         def static_method():
             print("This is a static method")

     MyClass.static_method()  # Output: This is a static method
     ```

### 11. **Class Methods**
   - **Definition**: A method that operates on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. It can modify class-level data.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.
     - Takes `cls` as the first argument instead of `self`.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     class MyClass:
         count = 0

         @classmethod
         def increment(cls):
             cls.count += 1
     
     MyClass.increment()
     print(MyClass.count)  # Output: 1
     ```

### 12. **Decorator Functions**
   - **Definition**: Decorators are functions that modify or enhance other functions. They are typically used to add functionality before or after the execution of a function.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - A decorator function takes another function as input and returns a modified version of it.
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     def decorator(func):
         def wrapper():
             print("Before the function call")
             func()
             print("After the function call")
         return wrapper
     
     @decorator
     def say_hello():
         print("Hello!")
     
     say_hello()
     # Output:
     # Before the function call
     # Hello!
     # After the function call
     ```
