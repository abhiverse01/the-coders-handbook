# Info
- This document ensembles the various key information and details that you learn throughout the years as a developer.
- There's a lot ot workflows, how-to's, extension meanings, data structure representations that we learn as we go around using them.
- It'd be better if you get to know it right away, to explore further from it, so that you don't have to start from entire scratch on your development journey.


# Extensions Meaning:
## .toml File

### Layman's Terms:
- **What it is:** A .toml file is like a recipe card for your project. It lists ingredients (dependencies) and instructions (configuration) in a simple, easy-to-read format.
- **Relevance:** Helps your project know what tools and libraries it needs to run properly.

### Technical Detail:
- **What it is:** TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a configuration file format that is easy to read due to its simple syntax. It is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table.
- **Usage:** Used for configuration in many tools and projects. In Python projects, `pyproject.toml` is used by Poetry to manage dependencies and project settings.
- **Example:**
  ```toml
  [tool.poetry]
  name = "my_project"
  version = "0.1.0"
  description = "A sample project"

  [tool.poetry.dependencies]
  python = "^3.8"
  requests = "^2.25.1"
  ```
-- .toml File:
-- Configuration: Provides a structured way to manage project configurations and dependencies.
-- Readability: Its simple syntax makes it easy to read and write.

## .lock File

### Layman's Terms:
- **What it is:** A .lock file is like a snapshot of all the ingredients (dependencies) your project needs at a specific time. It ensures everyone uses the same versions to avoid surprises.
- **Relevance:** Ensures consistency across different setups by locking dependency versions.

### Technical Detail:
- **What it is:** A lock file is automatically generated and contains the exact versions of dependencies and sub-dependencies that are installed.
- **Usage:** Ensures reproducibility and consistency by locking the versions of dependencies. For example, `poetry.lock` in Python projects managed by Poetry.
- **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  [[package]]
  name = "requests"
  version = "2.25.1"
  description = "Python HTTP for Humans."
  category = "main"
  optional = false
  python-versions = ">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*, !=3.4.*, <4"
  ```
-- .lock File:
-- Consistency: Ensures all developers and environments use the exact same versions of dependencies.
-- Reproducibility: Facilitates the recreation of the environment as it was when the lock file was generated.
  
## .yml and .yaml File

### Layman's Terms:
- **What it is:** .yml and .yaml files are like instruction manuals written in a very clean and readable format. They are used to describe how software components should be configured and interact.
- **Relevance:** Used for configurations in many applications and tools, such as Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure management.

### Technical Detail:
- **What it is:** YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard that can be used to write configuration files.
- **Usage:** Commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. For example, `docker-compose.yml` for Docker configurations and `pipeline.yaml` for CI/CD setups.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    web:
      image: myapp:latest
      ports:
        - "5000:5000"
      environment:
        - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
  ```

-- .yml and .yaml Files:
-- Flexibility: Used across various domains for configuration, from software development to infrastructure as code.
-- Clarity: The human-readable format helps in understanding complex configurations and setups.
