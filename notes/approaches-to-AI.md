## Various approaches to building an AI project:

### **1. Supervised Learning**

**Quantitative:**
- **Data Requirements**: Labeled data consisting of input-output pairs. Example: Images with corresponding labels or customer data with known outcomes.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Regression**: Predicts continuous values. Examples: Linear Regression (predicts house prices based on features), Lasso (adds regularization to avoid overfitting).
  - **Classification**: Categorizes data into predefined classes. Examples: Logistic Regression (predicts binary outcomes like spam or not), Support Vector Machines (classifies with maximal margin).
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted instances (e.g., 90% correct predictions).
  - **Precision**: Ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives (e.g., precision of 85% in classifying emails as spam).
  - **Recall**: Ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (e.g., recall of 80% in detecting fraud).
  - **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (e.g., F1 score of 0.82).
  - **MSE/RMSE**: Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error measure prediction error in regression (e.g., RMSE of 5 units).

**Qualitative:**
- **Description**: Supervised learning models are trained with explicit labels provided during training. The goal is to generalize from the training data to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. It’s akin to learning with a teacher guiding the learning process.
- **Usage**: Ideal for tasks where historical data with known outcomes is available, such as predicting customer churn, diagnosing medical conditions, or classifying text documents.

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**

**Quantitative:**

- **Algorithms**:
  - **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together. Examples: K-Means (partitions data into K clusters), Hierarchical Clustering (builds a hierarchy of clusters).
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of features while preserving essential information. Examples: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (transforms data into principal components), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (visualizes high-dimensional data).
- **Metrics**:
  - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters (e.g., silhouette score of 0.6 indicates good clustering).
  - **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances from points to their assigned cluster centre (e.g., lower inertia suggests better clustering).
  - **Explained Variance Ratio**: Proportion of variance captured by principal components (e.g., PCA components explaining 95% variance).

**Qualitative:**
- **Description**: Unsupervised learning uncovers hidden patterns or structures in data without predefined labels. It’s like exploring data without knowing what to expect, discovering groupings or reducing complexity.
- **Usage**: Useful for discovering underlying patterns in data, such as segmenting customers into market segments, detecting anomalies in network traffic, or visualizing high-dimensional datasets.
